# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Use SQL to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, create a report that summarizes the analysis and helps to prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
- retirement_titles.csv
  - Retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 ordered by employee number
There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables
- unique_titles.csv
  - Remove duplicate entries for some employees because they have switched titles over the years and keep only the most recent title of each employee.
- retiring_titles.csv
  - Retrieve the number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire.
- mentorship_eligibility.csv
  - Create a Mentorship Eligibility table that holds the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?


Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
